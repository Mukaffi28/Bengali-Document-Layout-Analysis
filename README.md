Bengali Document Layout Analysis Competition

 Welcome to our GitHub repository! 

We've utilized the BaDLAD dataset, which includes 33,365 Bengali documents annotated with polygon boundaries and rectangular bounding boxes. This dataset serves as the foundation for our Deep Learning competition, which is specifically designed to enhance Bengali Document Layout Analysis.


Inside this repository, you'll discover code built using Detectron 2, an open-source framework developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). This framework is tailored for creating and training computer vision models, with a special focus on object detection and segmentation tasks. Built on the powerful PyTorch library, Detectron 2 offers modular design, versatility for various tasks, efficient models, and customization options.


In our setup, we're arranging the path to pretrained model weights for Detectron 2, in the context of a Kaggle environment. The variable PRETRAINED_PATH holds the file path for pretrained model weights saved as model_final_weights_today.pth. This points to an earlier trained Detectron 2 model. These pretrained weights allow us to start with learned features for new tasks or further training.
